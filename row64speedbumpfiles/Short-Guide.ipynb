    "## The WPRDC, or, how to deal with open data\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, you dug through the WPRDC and had a chance to see the vast and varied data available there. During this project, you'll be dealing with quite a few datasets and data sources, but luckily they'll all be *open data*. Open data is, according to [Albert Lin](http://www.wprdc.org/news/so-you-want-to-use-open-data/) of the WPRDC, \"a complete set of primary data made easily and permanently available in a timely fashion using electronic, machine readable, open file formats. Cost should not pose a barrier to accessing information, and no unreasonable restrictions should limit accessibility, sharing and re-use.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "### A brief guide to the WPRDC\n",
    "\n",
    "Your primary source of data to analyze will be the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center, or WPRDC. We've used WPRDC data a lot over the past few weeks, but this is the first time you'll be exploring the vast expanses of its data before. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's a *lot* of data available, so it's important to know how to search through it and find what you want. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary way you'll find relevant datasets is through **keyword search**. From the master list of all datasets available at [data.wprdc.org](https://data.wprdc.org), just search for what you're looking for! For example, when I was looking for a list of all of the bus stops on Port Authority routes, I searched \"bus stops,\" and the first (and only) result was exactly what I wanted: [this lovely dataset](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/port-authority-of-allegheny-county-transit-stops).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, searching around can be fruitless if you're not exactly sure what kind of data are available; fortunately, the WPRDC groups their datasets into topic-centered **categories**, like health, public safety, and housing. The full list of categories is available here: [data.wprdc.org/group](https://data.wprdc.org/group). If you can't find the specific data you want by searching for it, or if you don't know what data you want exactly, try browsing through the relevant category or categories and see what you find.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can also sort by **publisher**. Each government agency or private group that displays data through the WPRDC has their own page listing all of the data they provide. You can view all of the organizations here: [data.wprdc.org/organization](https://data.wprdc.org/organization)."

    "As you see here, we can just give `pandas` a link to a data file from the internet and it'll just handle it; it's pretty great that way.

    "\n",
    "If you're dealing with data that isn't actively changing, like results from a diabetes study that occured in 2015, it's probably best to **use a local copy of the data** for your analysis. You've done this a lot; it's why our data analysis labs have been in GitHub repos that you `git clone` instead of just downloading a notebook. Managing a bunch of files can be fiddly, but GitHub makes it easy to distribute and manage projects. You can download local copies of WPRDC data from the site and use them in your projects like any other file we've worked with, using the `read_table()` and `read_csv()` functions in `pandas`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You may encounter some weird filetypes that we haven't dealt with in class. One I ran into was a `.dbf` file, which is an older type of database. To deal with `.dbf` files, we can use a module called `geopandas`, which normally is used for doing spatial/map stuff in data analysis. (You'll use `geopandas` elsewhere in your project, most likely.)\n",
